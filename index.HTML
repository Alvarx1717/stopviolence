    <h2>Our Mission Statement</h2>
    <p>
      Our mission is to confront and dismantle the systemic roots of gun violence through a lens of social justice, prioritizing the voices and leadership of those most affected. We recognize that gun violence is not only a public safety issue but also a profound civil rights crisis, deeply intertwined with racial inequality, poverty, and trauma.<br><br>
      Guided by the principle that those closest to the pain must lead the change, we empower communities of color to build political power, change the narrative, and advocate for policy reforms that center healing over punishment. We commit to trauma-informed, intersectional approaches that address the root causes of violence, economic disparity, structural racism, and disinvestment in marginalized neighborhoods.<br><br>
      Our work is rooted in the belief that justice is not merely the absence of violence but the presence of opportunity, dignity, and accountability. We are united by the vision of a society where every person can live free from the threat of gun violence, and where communities are empowered to shape their own futures.<br><br>
      Together, we strive to build a movement that is as inclusive as it is transformative, grounded in love, resilience, and the unwavering belief that a safer, more just world, is possible. But it is only possible if everyone unites!
